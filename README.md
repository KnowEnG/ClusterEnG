# ClusterEnG
ClusterEnG is an educational web resource on clustering and visualizing high-dimensional datasets. The resource currently offers visualization of PCA, t-SNE vectors of input dataset for several clustering algorithms. Furthermore, the user can also explore eighteen internal clustering validation measures to compare different clustering results. The application is located at http://education.knoweng.org/clustereng/.

The repository contains various javascript and algorithm files being used on ClusterEnG. There may be additional packages required in some of the files which can be downloaded 
from the respective websites. Sample datasets are also uploaded in the directory 'sampledata'.
